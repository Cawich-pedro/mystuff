	<h2>Here is a overview of the Characters of the series</h2>
	
</p>
<p><h2>Link</h2></p>
<img src="Link.png" style="width:600px;height:800px;">
<p align="center"><h3> Link the main protagonists of The Legend of Zelda series. There are many incarnations of Link, each possessing the Spirit of the Hero, with some of them being blood related as well. They are chosen by the Goddesses to protect the land from evil whenever deemed necessary.In the majority of Zelda games, their adventures take place within Hyrule, traveling through the land, collecting important items, and defeating a wide variety of enemies while trying to save both Princess Zelda and her kingdom from the clutches of Ganon, Vaati, or other villains.</h3> </p>

<p><h2>Princess Zelda</h2></p>

<img src="zelda.png" style="width:500px;height:700px;">
<p><h3>Zelda, while born as a Hylian, is the mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia. Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are often named after her and are always the crown princess of Hyrule throughout its history.Several princesses within the bloodline are also the possessor of the Triforce of Wisdom, imbued with the essence of the Goddess Nayru.The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to discern the wisest decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them a myriad of mystical abilities, including the ability to heal others, though there is a possibility that this could also be an effect of their bloodline passing down Hylia's own powers and, later, the Light Force.</h3> </p>

<p><h2>Ganon</h2></p>
<img src="Ganon.png" style="width:600px;height:800px;">
<p><h3>Introduced in The Legend of Zelda simply as a monstrous Prince of Darkness, Ganon's character has seen much development throughout the series, from being a simple monster to a powerful warlock with deeper motives to his actions. As the manifestation of the Demon King Demise's hatred for the Goddess and her Chosen Hero—or, according to Hyrule Historia, the reincarnation of Demise himself —Ganon is destined to eternally reincarnate to pursue world domination. In most cases though, he makes a return after being resurrected or breaking a seal. Four Swords Adventures is a notable exception, featuring a reincarnated Ganondorf.The original Ganondorf from Ocarina of Time appears in the rest of the games, making him stand out from other villains as the same character from game-to-game. </h3></p>
